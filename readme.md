# üìåCardiac MRI Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Estimation

This project focuses on estimating the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) from Cardiac MRI images using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `3D/`: Contains 3D models or related data.
- `Plots/`: Includes visualization files for data analysis.
- `dataset/`: Directory for dataset files used in training and evaluation.
- `tb_logs/`: Stores TensorBoard logs for monitoring training performance.
- `preview.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for previewing data or model outputs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `run.py`: Main script to execute the training or evaluation pipeline.
- `testing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for testing and validating the model.

## üöÄInstallation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fosii/cmr-lvef-estimation.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd cmr-lvef-estimation

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## üõ†Usage

- **Running the main script:** Execute the `run.py` script to start the training or evaluation process:
  ```bash
  python run.py
- **Visualizing results:** Use the Jupyter Notebooks `preview.ipynb` and `testing.ipynb` to visualize data samples and evaluate model performance.
